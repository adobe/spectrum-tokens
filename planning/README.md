# Spectrum Design Data

This directory contains the comprehensive plan for **Spectrum Design Data** - a design system agnostic evolution from design tokens to a complete contextual data management system. Originally developed for the Spectrum Design System, this represents a universal solution for any design system seeking to move from simple name-value pairs to rich, intelligent design data that understands context, relationships, and platform requirements.

## Strategic Vision: Design System Infrastructure as a Platform

**Spectrum Design Data** is architected to be **design system agnostic**, creating opportunities for:

- **üåç Open Source Leadership**: Position Adobe as the leader in design system infrastructure
- **üíº Enterprise Product Offering**: Productize as Adobe Design System Platform for enterprise customers
- **ü§ù Industry Adoption**: Enable other design systems (Material, Carbon, Fluent, etc.) to adopt the same intelligent infrastructure
- **üìà Market Expansion**: Transform from internal tooling to industry-standard design data platform

## Overview

Design systems universally face coordination challenges across multiple designers and implementation platforms - a common pattern across the industry (Material Design, Carbon, Fluent, etc.). **Spectrum Design Data** proposes a systematic, reusable solution that transforms how any design system captures, manages, and distributes design decisions across platforms - moving from static tokens to intelligent, contextual design data.

## The Evolution: From Tokens to Design Data

**Spectrum Design Data** represents a fundamental shift in how we think about design systems:

- **From**: Static name-value pairs (design tokens)
- **To**: Rich, contextual, intelligent design data
- **From**: Manual coordination across platforms
- **To**: Automated, semantic understanding of design relationships
- **From**: Platform-agnostic data that requires interpretation
- **To**: Platform-aware data that adapts to native conventions
