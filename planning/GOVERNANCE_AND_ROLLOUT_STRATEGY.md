# Spectrum Design Data: Governance and Rollout Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the governance structure and phased rollout strategy for evolving Spectrum Tokens into Spectrum Design Data. It addresses the multi-team coordination challenges, version fragmentation, and diverse platform needs while establishing sustainable governance processes that respect voluntary adoption constraints.

## Current State Analysis

### Implementation Teams and Status

Based on the organizational context, we have multiple implementation teams with varying needs and version adoption:

#### **Public/OSS Teams**

- **React Spectrum**: Public OSS, likely on newer versions (v13.x.x)
- **Spectrum CSS**: Public OSS, foundation for other implementations
- **Spectrum Web Components**: Public OSS, consumes Spectrum CSS

#### **Internal Adobe Teams**

- **Spectrum iOS**: Internal team, version status varies
- **Spectrum Android**: Internal team, version status varies
- **Spectrum Drover**: Desktop application framework, internal
- **Spectrum Qt**: Internal team, version status varies

#### **Version Fragmentation Challenge**

- Some teams on v12.x.x (older architecture)
- Some teams on v13.x.x (newer architecture)
- Different adoption timelines and priorities
- Varying technical constraints and requirements

### Governance Structure

#### **Monthly Governance Meetings**

The planned monthly governance meetings will be crucial for:

- Coordinating cross-platform changes
- Reviewing RFC proposals
- Managing version migration timelines
- Resolving platform-specific conflicts
- Prioritizing feature development

## RFC-Driven Development Process

### Enhanced RFC Process for Rust Architecture

Building on the existing RFC process (as seen in [GitHub discussion #507](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-tokens/discussions/507)), we'll extend it for the new architecture:

### RFC Examples for New Architecture

#### **RFC: Component Lifecycle Metadata System**

```markdown
# RFC: Implement Swift-like Component Lifecycle Metadata

## Summary

Implement comprehensive lifecycle metadata system similar to Swift's @available attribute.

## Motivation

Current deprecation system is limited. Need rich lifecycle information for:

- Automated migration tooling
- Platform-specific deprecation timelines
- Cross-platform coordination

## Detailed Design

[Reference to RUST_LIFECYCLE_ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md]

## Platform Impact Analysis

### React Spectrum (v13.2.0+)

- **Benefits**: Automated deprecation warnings, migration codemods
- **Migration**: Requires updating to new lifecycle hooks
- **Timeline**: 2 sprints

### Spectrum iOS (Internal)

- **Benefits**: Native Swift @available attribute generation
- **Migration**: Update to new SDK with lifecycle bindings
- **Timeline**: 3 sprints (App Store considerations)

### Spectrum CSS (v13.1.0+)

- **Benefits**: CSS deprecation warnings, automated prefixing
- **Migration**: Update build tools to consume lifecycle data
- **Timeline**: 1 sprint

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1**: Core Rust implementation (4 weeks)
2. **Phase 2**: Platform SDK integration (6 weeks)
3. **Phase 3**: Tooling and automation (4 weeks)
4. **Phase 4**: Platform team adoption (8 weeks)

## Open Questions

1. Should lifecycle metadata be mandatory for all new components?
2. How do we handle platforms that can't adopt immediately?
3. What's the migration timeline for existing deprecated components?
```

## Phased Implementation Strategy

### **Backwards Compatibility Commitment**

**Important**: While we work towards building implementation-specific SDKs with the new Rust architecture, we will continue to publish `@adobe/spectrum-tokens` in the current JSON format as long as needed for backwards compatibility. This ensures that:

- Teams can migrate at their own pace without being forced to adopt the new architecture
- Existing integrations continue to work without disruption
- The transition is gradual and non-breaking for all platform teams
- Legacy systems maintain access to design tokens during the migration period

The current `@adobe/spectrum-tokens` package will be maintained and updated alongside the new architecture until all teams have successfully migrated and no longer require the legacy format.

### Phase 1: Build System Enhancement (Months 1-3)

### Gradual Migration Path

1. **Phase 1**: Upgrade to latest v13.x.x
2. **Phase 2**: Adopt new SDK alongside existing tokens
3. **Phase 3**: Migrate to new architecture incrementally
4. **Phase 4**: Full cutover to new system

## For Teams on v13.x.x

### Accelerated Adoption

- [ ] Direct migration path to new architecture
- [ ] Early access to new features
- [ ] Pilot program participation
- [ ] Feedback integration into development
```

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks

#### **Risk: Platform Team Adoption Resistance**

- **Mitigation**: Gradual rollout, clear benefits demonstration, migration support
- **Contingency**: Extended parallel system support, dedicated migration resources

#### **Risk: Performance Impact**

- **Mitigation**: Performance testing, optimization phases, monitoring
- **Contingency**: Performance rollback plan, optimization sprints

#### **Risk: Breaking Changes Impact**

- **Mitigation**: Careful versioning, migration tooling, extended support periods
- **Contingency**: Rollback procedures, hotfix processes

### Organizational Risks

#### **Risk: Governance Process Overhead**

- **Mitigation**: Streamlined processes, clear decision frameworks, efficient meetings
- **Contingency**: Process simplification, decision authority delegation

#### **Risk: Resource Constraints**

- **Mitigation**: Phased implementation, priority-based rollout, resource planning
- **Contingency**: Timeline adjustments, scope reduction, additional resources

## Success Metrics

## Conclusion

This governance and rollout strategy provides a structured approach to implementing the comprehensive Rust architecture while respecting the diverse needs, constraints, and timelines of all platform teams. The phased approach, enhanced RFC process, and robust governance framework ensure successful adoption across Adobe's complex ecosystem.

The key to success will be:

1. **Gradual Implementation**: Respecting current version constraints and migration timelines
2. **Platform Autonomy**: Enabling platform-specific overrides and customizations
3. **Strong Governance**: Clear processes for coordination and decision-making
4. **Migration Support**: Comprehensive tooling and support for version transitions
5. **Continuous Feedback**: Regular governance meetings and RFC-driven development

This approach transforms the ambitious technical architecture into a practical, achievable implementation plan that works within Adobe's organizational realities while delivering the long-term benefits of a unified, scalable design system infrastructure.
