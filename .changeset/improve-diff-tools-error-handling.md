**feat(diff-tools): improve error handling and GitHub PR comment format**

This update significantly improves both diff tools with better error handling, comprehensive test coverage, and enhanced GitHub PR comment formatting.

## Component Diff Generator Improvements

### ✅ GitHub PR Comment Format Alignment

- **Collapsible details sections** for better visual hierarchy (resolves #576)
- **Handlebars templating** for consistent formatting with token diff generator
- **Progressive disclosure** - key info visible, details collapsed by default
- **Branch/version information** prominently displayed at top

### ✅ Comprehensive Test Coverage

- **11 new template error handling tests** covering malformed templates, missing files, permission errors
- **6 new real-world integration tests** with actual Adobe Spectrum component schemas
- **Doubled test count**: 17 → 34 tests with 100% code coverage maintained

## Token Diff Generator Improvements

### ✅ Enhanced Error Handling & Test Coverage

- **10+ new formatter error handling tests** for template processing edge cases
- **12+ new store-output edge case tests** for file system operations
- **Improved coverage**: store-output.js from 69% → 84% (+14.71%)
- **Total test count**: ~238 → 260 tests (+22 tests)

### ✅ Robust Error Scenarios Tested

- Template syntax errors and missing helpers
- File permission and access errors
- Large dataset performance testing
- Unicode and special character handling
- Concurrent write operations
- Network timeout simulations

## Business Impact

- **Reduced PR review friction** with better formatted diff comments
- **Improved reliability** through comprehensive error handling
- **Better developer experience** with consistent tooling across diff generators
- **Production-ready** with 294 total tests passing and zero breaking changes

## Technical Details

- All existing functionality preserved (zero breaking changes)
- Enhanced error messages and graceful failure handling
- Performance tested with large Adobe Spectrum-scale schemas
- Cross-platform compatibility maintained
- Memory usage optimized for large datasets
