Repository has been renamed from `spectrum-tokens` to `spectrum-design-data` to better reflect that this monorepo contains more than just design tokens. All GitHub repository URLs and documentation have been updated to reference the new repository location at `github.com/adobe/spectrum-design-data`.

**Important:** NPM package names remain unchanged (`@adobe/spectrum-tokens`, `@adobe/spectrum-component-api-schemas`) to avoid breaking existing consumers.

The following files were updated:

- All `package.json` files with repository URLs
- Main `README.md` with new repository references
- Documentation in `docs/visualizer/README.md`
- Schema URLs in token files to reference the new hosted location
- Test files with schema references

Note: Historical changelog entries that reference the old repository name in commit and PR URLs are intentionally preserved for historical accuracy.
