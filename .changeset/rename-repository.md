"@adobe/spectrum-tokens": minor
---

Repository has been renamed from `spectrum-tokens` to `spectrum-design-data` to better reflect that this monorepo contains more than just design tokens. All GitHub repository URLs and documentation have been updated to reference the new repository location at `github.com/adobe/spectrum-design-data`.

**Important:** NPM package names remain unchanged (`@adobe/spectrum-tokens`, `@adobe/spectrum-component-api-schemas`) to avoid breaking existing consumers.

The following files were updated:

- All `package.json` files with repository URLs
- Main `README.md` with new repository references
- Documentation in `docs/visualizer/README.md`
- Schema URLs in token files to reference the new hosted location
- Test files with schema references

**Schema Reference Simplification:**
As part of this change, all JSON Schema references have been simplified from absolute URLs to relative paths:

- Token files now use relative `$schema` references (e.g., `"alias.json"` instead of `"https://opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-tokens/schemas/token-types/alias.json"`)
- Schema definition files updated to use relative `$id` and `$ref` values
- Maintains full JSON Schema validation functionality with cleaner, more maintainable syntax
- Significantly reduces file size and improves readability

Note: Historical changelog entries that reference the old repository name in commit and PR URLs are intentionally preserved for historical accuracy.
