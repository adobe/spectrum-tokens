Added new semantic color aliases to Tokens Studio, in the S2 color tokens, alias sets for both light and dark themes.

## Design Motivation

New values for tag component for S2. New negative-subdued background tokens were needed for negative and not selected tag components.

## Token Diff

_Tokens added (4):_

- `negative-subdued-background-color-default`
- `negative-subdued-background-color-down`
- `negative-subdued-background-color-hover`
- `negative-subdued-background-color-key-focus`
