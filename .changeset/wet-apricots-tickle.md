Updated S2 swatch tokens and added swatch-group tokens in S2 Color and S2 Non-color data sets, respectively.

## Design Motivation

Swatch and swatch group components are being formalized as Spectrum 2 components. These tokens define the design data needed for implementation. Changes include updated corner rounding, colors and spacing for spacious density.
