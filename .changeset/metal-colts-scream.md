Updated code tokens for S2

## Design Motivation

These code token updates include some fixes to CJK font-weights to match the Latin font-weights when possible. We added CJK size tokens for consistency with other typography style tokens. Note that the new CJK size tokens currently point to the default code font-size tokens since Source Code Pro handles Latin and CJK sizing comparably.
