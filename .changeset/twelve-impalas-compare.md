Spectrum 2 Toast Tokens

## Design motivation

Updated the `color-area-border-rounding` token type from spacing to borderRadius and adjusted value referenced, desktop and mobile scale.

These changes occurred as a result of scaling things for S2 design language and experiences.

## Token Diff

_Token values updated (5):_

- `toast-height`
- `toast-top-to-workflow-icon`
- `toast-top-to-text`
- `toast-bottom-to-text`
- `color-area-border-rounding`
