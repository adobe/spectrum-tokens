Updated values and added new tokens for Switch.

## Design Motivation

Added new tokens: `switch-handle-size-_` and `switch-handle-selected-size-_` for both desktop and mobile.
Update token values on: `switch-control-width-_` and `switch-control-height-_` for both desktop and mobile.

The design for Switch in S2 has changed and now has a border when it's not selected. New handle sizes are added and control sizes have been updated.
