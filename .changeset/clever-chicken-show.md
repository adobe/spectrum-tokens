Tag field and missing icon tokens

## Design Motivation

- These are the required tokens for the tag fields component.
- These UI icons already exist and are being used in number field, menu items, swatch and list view.
- This was brought up on Slack by the CSS team in the implementation channel
  When we initially added the first batch of UI icons size tokens, these specific icons were not used in components yet, but now are, which is why they're missing.
