Added new and updating existing background layer tokens to S2 set in Tokens Studio and S2/Variables. Also reordered token organization to reflect proper usage based on [S2 guidelines](https://s2.spectrum.corp.adobe.com/page/background-layers/#editing-contexts).

## Design Motivation

In Spectrum 2, background layers are used differently depending on the primary context of the page. We now have a full set of tokens to help users distinguish between primary purposes, editing vs browsing.

## Token Diff

_Tokens added (2):_

- `background-elevated-color`
- `background-pasteboard-color`

_Token values updated (1):_

- `background-base-color`
