# Spectrum Tokens Release Timeline

Interactive visualization showing the frequency and scope of Spectrum Tokens releases over time.

## Overview

This visualization displays the release history of Spectrum Tokens across different formats and time periods:

- **Legacy releases** (v12.2.0 format) - Pre-monorepo structure
- **Stable releases** (@adobe/spectrum-tokens@13.13.0) - Production releases
- **Beta releases** (@adobe/spectrum-tokens@13.0.0-beta.47) - Pre-release validation
- **Snapshot releases** (@adobe/spectrum-tokens@0.0.0-feature-timestamp) - Experimental development

## Features

### Statistics Dashboard

- Total release counts by type
- Development timespan and activity metrics
- Feature development area breakdown

### Timeline Visualization

- Chronological view of all releases
- Color-coded by release type
- Interactive tooltips with release details

### Monthly Activity Chart

- Release frequency trends over time
- Identifies periods of high/low activity
- Helps visualize development cycles

### Feature Development Breakdown

- Snapshot releases grouped by development initiative
- Shows active areas of experimental work
- Highlights core development priorities

## Usage

### Development Server

```bash
cd docs/release-timeline
moon run dev
```

Open http://localhost:8080 to view the visualization.

### Update Data

The visualization uses data generated by the release-analyzer tool:

```bash
# From tools/release-analyzer
node src/cli.js analyze --stats-only --pretty --output ../../docs/release-timeline/public/data/releases.json
```

Or use the build task:

```bash
moon run build
```

## Data Source

Data is generated from git tags in the spectrum-tokens repository using the `@adobe/spectrum-tokens-release-analyzer` tool. The tool parses:

- Git tag formats across repository history
- Release dates from git metadata
- Feature names from snapshot release tags
- Version information and prerelease indicators

## Business Context

This visualization supports analysis of design system coordination costs by showing:

1. **Release Frequency**: High activity requiring cross-team coordination
2. **Development Streams**: Multiple concurrent workstreams (stable, beta, experimental)
3. **Feature Innovation**: Experimental snapshot releases showing rapid iteration
4. **Scale Evidence**: 220+ releases requiring coordination across 6+ implementation teams

Perfect for demonstrating the value of systematic token infrastructure in managing design system complexity at Adobe's scale.

## GitHub Pages Deployment

This visualization can be deployed to GitHub Pages alongside other documentation tools in the spectrum-tokens repository.
