# Spectrum Tokens

---

# Note: This project is in beta right now.

---

Design tokens are all the values needed to construct and maintain a design system — spacing, color, typography, object styles, animation, etc. — represented as data. These can represent anything defined by design: a color as a RGB value, an opacity as a number, an animation ease as Bezier coordinates. They’re used in place of hard-coded values in order to ensure flexibility and unity across all product experiences.

Design tokens are directly integrated into our component libraries, UI kits, and the Spectrum XD plugin. They cover the various options of platform scales, color themes, component states, and more. We also offer teams a variety of token types to use directly within their products if they are not using a Spectrum component library.
