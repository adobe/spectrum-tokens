## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#577](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-tokens/pull/577) [`e4053fb`](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-tokens/commit/e4053fb7a92c000c6c6efde1766766e8fa6aa0d2) Thanks [@GarthDB](https://github.com/GarthDB)! - **feat(diff-tools): improve error handling and GitHub PR comment format**

  This update significantly improves both diff tools with better error handling, comprehensive test coverage, and enhanced GitHub PR comment formatting.

  ## Component Diff Generator Improvements

  ### ✅ GitHub PR Comment Format Alignment
  - **Collapsible details sections** for better visual hierarchy (resolves #576)
  - **Handlebars templating** for consistent formatting with token diff generator
  - **Progressive disclosure** - key info visible, details collapsed by default
  - **Branch/version information** prominently displayed at top

  ### ✅ Comprehensive Test Coverage
  - **11 new template error handling tests** covering malformed templates, missing files, permission errors
  - **6 new real-world integration tests** with actual Adobe Spectrum component schemas
  - **Doubled test count**: 17 → 34 tests with 100% code coverage maintained

  ## Token Diff Generator Improvements

  ### ✅ Enhanced Error Handling & Test Coverage
  - **10+ new formatter error handling tests** for template processing edge cases
  - **12+ new store-output edge case tests** for file system operations
  - **Improved coverage**: store-output.js from 69% → 84% (+14.71%)
  - **Total test count**: ~238 → 260 tests (+22 tests)

  ### ✅ Robust Error Scenarios Tested
  - Template syntax errors and missing helpers
  - File permission and access errors
  - Large dataset performance testing
  - Unicode and special character handling
  - Concurrent write operations
  - Network timeout simulations

  ## Business Impact
  - **Reduced PR review friction** with better formatted diff comments
  - **Improved reliability** through comprehensive error handling
  - **Better developer experience** with consistent tooling across diff generators
  - **Production-ready** with 294 total tests passing and zero breaking changes

  ## Technical Details
  - All existing functionality preserved (zero breaking changes)
  - Enhanced error messages and graceful failure handling
  - Performance tested with large Adobe Spectrum-scale schemas
  - Cross-platform compatibility maintained
  - Memory usage optimized for large datasets

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#573](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-tokens/pull/573) [`cd74579`](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-tokens/commit/cd745798b88a137ee6fac8734cc872626fd09060) Thanks [@GarthDB](https://github.com/GarthDB)! - feat(tools): add component schema diff generator with shared core library

  **New Tools:**
  - `@adobe/spectrum-component-diff-generator` - CLI tool for comparing component schemas between versions/branches
  - `@adobe/spectrum-diff-core` - Shared library providing common diff functionality across tools

  **Key Features:**
  - Dynamic file discovery using GitHub API
  - Breaking vs non-breaking change detection for JSON schemas
  - Support for remote-to-remote, remote-to-local, and local-to-local comparisons
  - Professional markdown, JSON, and CLI output formats
  - Integration with GitHub Actions for automated PR comments
  - Comprehensive test coverage with AVA

  **CLI Usage:**

  ```bash
  # Compare between versions
  sdiff report --osv v1.0.0 --nsv v1.1.0 --format markdown

  # Compare between branches
  sdiff report --osb main --nsb feature-branch --format json

  # Local comparisons
  sdiff report --osv v1.0.0 --local packages/component-schemas
  ```

  This enables automated component schema change detection and reporting across Adobe Spectrum's design system workflow.
