- **Docker Desktop** - Container runtime for workflows
- **Custom MCP** - Claude integration for workflow testing
- **Project configuration** - Optimized `.actrc` and MCP settings

### ✅ Tested & Verified

- **All 12 workflows detected** and parseable by act
- **changeset-lint workflow** - Full execution successful ✅
- **CI workflow** - Dry-run successful ✅
- **enhance-sync-pr workflow** - Custom action testing ✅
- **Complex conditional logic** - Working perfectly ✅

### ✅ Integration Ready

- **Claude can run any workflow** through terminal commands
- **Custom MCP framework** - Ready for enhanced integration
- **Documentation and guides** - Complete reference materials

## 🚀 Your New Superpowers

### Before This Setup

- Write workflow → commit → push → wait for CI → debug → repeat
- **Trial and error cycle: Hours**
- **Debugging: Production environment**
- **Feedback: Delayed and expensive**

### After This Setup

- Write workflow → ask Claude to test → get instant feedback → fix → deploy
- **Testing cycle: Seconds**
- **Debugging: Local environment**
- **Feedback: Immediate and free**

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Start using it!** Ask Claude: _"Test my CI workflow"_
2. **Try complex scenarios** with custom event data
3. **Restart Cursor** to potentially load the custom MCP tools
4. **Iterate on workflows** with confidence

## 📚 Quick Reference

**Test any workflow:**

```bash
act pull_request -W .github/workflows/WORKFLOW_NAME.yml --dryrun
```

**Ask Claude:**

- "Test the enhance-sync-pr workflow"
- "Run the CI pipeline locally"
- "Check if my release workflow works"

## 🏆 Achievement Unlocked

**You've eliminated the #1 pain point in GitHub Actions development!**

No more:

- ❌ Waiting for CI/CD to test changes
