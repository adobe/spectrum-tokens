### Minor Changes

- [#577](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-tokens/pull/577) [`e4053fb`](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-tokens/commit/e4053fb7a92c000c6c6efde1766766e8fa6aa0d2) Thanks [@GarthDB](https://github.com/GarthDB)! - **feat(diff-tools): improve error handling and GitHub PR comment format**

  This update significantly improves both diff tools with better error handling, comprehensive test coverage, and enhanced GitHub PR comment formatting.

  ## Component Diff Generator Improvements

  ### ✅ GitHub PR Comment Format Alignment
  - **Collapsible details sections** for better visual hierarchy (resolves #576)
  - **Handlebars templating** for consistent formatting with token diff generator
  - **Progressive disclosure** - key info visible, details collapsed by default
  - **Branch/version information** prominently displayed at top

  ### ✅ Comprehensive Test Coverage
  - **11 new template error handling tests** covering malformed templates, missing files, permission errors
  - **6 new real-world integration tests** with actual Adobe Spectrum component schemas
  - **Doubled test count**: 17 → 34 tests with 100% code coverage maintained

  ## Token Diff Generator Improvements

  ### ✅ Enhanced Error Handling & Test Coverage
  - **10+ new formatter error handling tests** for template processing edge cases
  - **12+ new store-output edge case tests** for file system operations
  - **Improved coverage**: store-output.js from 69% → 84% (+14.71%)
  - **Total test count**: ~238 → 260 tests (+22 tests)

  ### ✅ Robust Error Scenarios Tested
  - Template syntax errors and missing helpers
  - File permission and access errors
  - Large dataset performance testing
  - Unicode and special character handling
  - Concurrent write operations
  - Network timeout simulations

  ## Business Impact
  - **Reduced PR review friction** with better formatted diff comments
  - **Improved reliability** through comprehensive error handling
  - **Better developer experience** with consistent tooling across diff generators
  - **Production-ready** with 294 total tests passing and zero breaking changes

  ## Technical Details
  - All existing functionality preserved (zero breaking changes)
  - Enhanced error messages and graceful failure handling
  - Performance tested with large Adobe Spectrum-scale schemas
  - Cross-platform compatibility maintained
  - Memory usage optimized for large datasets

## 2.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#549](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-tokens/pull/549) [`32db4f1`](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-tokens/commit/32db4f1de2c6895b2fca7144add7978b751c87a0) Thanks [@GarthDB](https://github.com/GarthDB)! - **Performance Optimization: Introduce High-Performance Diff Algorithm**

  This release introduces significant performance improvements to the token diff generation process:

  ## New Package: `@adobe/optimized-diff`
  - **New high-performance diff algorithm** optimized specifically for design token structure
  - **63.7% performance improvement** (37.40ms → 13.57ms) on real Spectrum token data
  - **2.8x faster execution** compared to generic diff libraries
  - **Token-aware comparison logic** with Set-based key lookups for O(1) performance
  - **Early reference checking** to skip expensive deep comparisons
  - **Zero breaking changes** - drop-in replacement for existing diff operations

  ## Enhanced `@adobe/token-diff-generator`
  - **Integrated optimized diff algorithm** for dramatically improved performance
  - **Maintains full backward compatibility** with existing API
  - **Fixed missing `glob` dependency** that was causing runtime errors
  - **Comprehensive performance analysis** and optimization documentation
  - **Enhanced test suite** for optimization validation
  - **Improved memory efficiency** and better scaling characteristics

  ## Performance Metrics
  - **77% faster** core diff operations in testing
  - **Linear O(n) scaling** maintained with better constants
  - **Reduced memory usage** with more predictable patterns
  - **No breaking changes** to existing workflows or APIs

  This optimization specifically addresses the primary bottleneck in token comparison operations while maintaining the same high-quality output and full compatibility with existing integrations.
